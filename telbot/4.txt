Centorrior
Attribute: Darkus, Pyrus Power: Unknown
(Japanese version Faust (ファウスト, Fausuto?)) is a centaur-like Darkus/Pyrus hybrid Bakugan created by Naga. He looks like he is a little bit more Darkus than Pyrus. He is a massive centaur-like Bakugan that carries a spear, which is similar to the one carried by Darkus Siege. Centorrior originally appears in the realm of Pyrus and Darkus alongside Druman.
